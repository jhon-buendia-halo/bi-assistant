## 2026-10-04 — 0.2.2 Rebuildable system specs (BA-90)

### What went well
- Agreeing the format before any backfill paid off. `specs/README.md`, with its templates and stack-neutrality rule, was written first, so 11 parallel agents produced 33 consistent files.
- A scripted acceptance check (`evidence/0.2.2/spec-checks.py`) verified the claims mechanically:
  - every link resolves;
  - every Gherkin Feature moved verbatim into exactly one capability spec;
  - every route, collection and agent is covered.
- Reading the code to write specs worked as an audit. It surfaced a token-redaction leak, a visual version collision after revert, plaintext datasource secrets and an unauthenticated all-interfaces bind. All are logged in `evidence/0.2.2/findings.md` instead of being silently "specified".

### What went wrong
- The first Epic gate edits were made on the Conductor branch `jhon-buendia-halo/new-chat`, before any Jira issue existed. That broke the rule being written. The branch was renamed only once BA-90 existed.
- BA-84 had no parent epic, so the previous harness change would have failed its own new gate.
- Agent prompts said "move the Feature from gherkin.md" and also "don't touch gherkin.md". One agent edited it and the others didn't, so the move had to be finished by hand.
- An unrequested extra Feature ("Chat answers and reliability signals") was added by an agent. It is useful, but it was not asked for.
- The first version of the CI check was too weak in one place and too strict in another. Its route check matched substrings, so `/sessions` passed for any sessions route. Its E2E check treated cross-references as ownership. A drift test with injected faults exposed and fixed both.
- No E2E run: the change touches no code or tests, so the suite was not re-run. The stale `application-shell` baseline found by the UI agent is unverified.

### What to do differently
- Before the first file edit of any task, create the Jira issue and rename the branch. That applies even to "just a docs tweak", because the Epic gate has no docs exemption.
- When fanning out a move across agents, give exactly one owner the delete of the source file: either the orchestrator or one named agent. Tell all other agents "copy only".
- Every new CI check gets a drift test before it ships: inject one fault per check, confirm each check fails, then revert. A check that has never failed proves nothing.
- When a spec backfill finds a bug, record it as an Open question in the spec and in the evidence findings, then ask the user before filing Jira bugs. Never fix code inside a spec-only change.

## 2026-10-01 — Adopt delivery workflow harness

### What went well
- The harness was ported from another project and adapted to this repo's real layout (Playwright-on-Electron in `frontend/e2e/`, Jest in `backend/`, phase plans in `docs/plans/`) instead of copied verbatim.

### What went wrong
- `gherkin.md` was seeded from existing E2E test titles only; the Given/When/Then steps are not written yet, so it is not yet a full spec.
- The phase plans in `docs/plans/` have unknown completion status, so they were parked in the roadmap Backlog rather than sequenced.

### What to do differently
- The first time a change touches a seeded Gherkin feature, write that feature's full Given/When/Then steps as part of step 5.
- Before starting work from a `docs/plans/` phase, confirm with the user which items already shipped, then promote the remainder into a milestone.
