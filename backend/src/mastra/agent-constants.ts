/**
 * Step budget for one assistant turn — analysis often chains several schema +
 * SQL tool calls. Shared by `SessionsService.agentContext` (a real chat turn)
 * and the assistant eval harness (`assistant.evals.ts`), so an eval measures
 * the agent under the same constraints production runs it with.
 *
 * Deliberately kept in its own file with no other imports: pulling in this
 * one number must not drag `@mastra/core/agent` (and its ESM-only transitive
 * deps, e.g. `@sindresorhus/slugify`) into modules — like
 * `SessionsService` — that Jest loads under CommonJS and that only need the
 * number, not the `Agent` class.
